# AESTextEncrypter
Text encrypter / decrypter based on Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

INTRODUCTION :
This is my first GUI Project based on Java. 
This is a basic text encrypter which can encrypt any standars text format with AES(Advanced Encryption Standard) with key lengths :
128 bits (deafault), 192 bits & 256 bits.
For the key lengths except 128 bits , this package requires additional "Unlimited JCE Policy" to be applied to the running JRE.

FEATURES :
1. Multiple key lengths (128 bits , 192 bits & 256 bits)
2. Offers File saving & loading for various purpose. You can save & load the encryption keys, encrypted messages & decrypted messages.
3. Easy to use.
4. Really basic :p

BUGS :
1. Salt feature doesn't work , still under development.
2. You let me know...

REQUIREMENTS :
1. Java Runtime Environment 7 +
2. Unlimited JCE Policy to be applied to JRE (only for key sizes :192 bits & 256 bits) 



PLEASE REVIEW THE CODE & SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT.
